The only requirement for this should be to have your Node.js installation to be high enough.
My current Node.js version is v16.14.2. Lower is likely possible, but I didn't test all scenarios.

To install, just run either `npm install` or `yarn install` from root. Once installed, you can run
the script with either `npm start` or `yarn run start`. Please reach out if you have any trouble.

Unfortunately, I ran out of time to write up automated tests, but I believe I met the other requirements.
